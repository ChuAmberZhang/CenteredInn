## Testing
We have not yet organized a testing system yet. We welcome you to contribute!

## How to submit changes: Pull Request protocol etc. 
Please submit a pull request only after you have tested it for conflicting versions. We would appreicate detailed commit messages and a clean history as well!

## How to report a bug: 
If you find any bugs (I'm sure there's a lot, since it's the first iteration), please contact us! 
Some easy bugs to solve right away include validation problems with our various forms and requests.
    
## New Feature Requirements
We would like to explore the Amadeus Technology Innovation Sandbox api more! There are a lot of information that we are getting and can get from the api calls but we haven't had the time to make use of it yet!
We also would like to incoporate social media and human factors into our project.
Last but least, we need to improve the security, stability and functionality of our user account system. 
One feature that we didn't finish is a save-list functionality for users to save the results of their searches.

## Recognition model
We will create a CONTRIBUTORS file to recognize any contributors who made a great impact!

## Where can I ask for help?
